This is a developmental repo of the Score-Keeper Web App for the Buttons-Up Game.
The Buttos up game in its simplicity, is a reaction button press game between two opponents.
A load of JavaScript code has been integrated into the site to increase the overall App experience beyond result logging.
The target of the game is to achieve the initially selected target-rounds to win, in order to overcome your opponent, and be crowned Champion! ðŸ¥‡
